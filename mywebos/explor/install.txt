INSTALLING AE UNDER WINDOWS

 If AE comes as a JAR file

 This is the java version, the sole that is maintained starting July 2001.
 The Java 1.3 package must be installed. It may be already installed along with
your Internet browser. Otherwise you have to download the JRE from the Sun's
site   http://java.sun.com
 or from another freeware site, or a cdrom.

 The autoexec.bat file should contains the line:
            CLASSPATH=c:\ae24\ae.jar

 You must add an icon to the desktop and the program path should be:
            javaw  -jar c:\ae24\ae.jar

N.B:
- If the classpath is already used, you can add c:\ae\ae.jar to it, separated by
a semi-colon.
- the path c:\ae  should be replaced by the one you choose to install AE into.
- the working directory should be preferably the path of ae.jar.


 Installing AE.JAR without classpath

 If the process above seems too much complicate for you, you may process
diferently:

1) Unzip the ae.jar archive inside a directory, c:\ae for example.
2) Create an icon for the javaw.exe program (inside the Java path).
3) Change the properties. Add ae as parameter to javaw.exe
    Example:
    c:\jre\bin\javaw.exe ae
   Set the working path the one where ae.jar is unzipped.
 


 If A.E. comes inside an archive

 This is the case if you want to update the program. Use a program as PKzip or
or Zipcentral or Info-Zip.
(Unziping can be done also by AE itself if a previous version is installed).



SETTING UP THE PROGRAM

 Once AE is installed you have to set it up, for associating extensions with
programs, (specially HTML) and detecting the available drives.
 This is achieved by a click on the AutoSetup button at top of the Setup panel
(the last tab).
 Associations can be created also with the Association panel in Setup.
 Drives units may be added also by typing their name, ex:        a:
 in the fields on top of each directory windows (followed by a press on the
Enter key). Use the right mouse button to open a menu that allows to register
permanently the path.


INSTALLING AE under LINUX

  Just extract the archive.
You can run the program with the command:
  java -jar ae.jar
you can create an icon with this command as property.
